## Custom System Development and Integration

You rely on Nordbrains for complex integrations. We connect your CRM, ERP, and third-party services using secure APIs.

For example, integrate a payment gateway:

<CodeGroup tabs="Node.js,Python">
  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();

  app.post('/integrate-payment', async (req, res) => {
    const { amount, token } = req.body;
    const response = await fetch('https://api.paymentprovider.com/charge', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}` },
      body: JSON.stringify({ amount, token })
    });
    res.json(await response.json());
  });
  ```
  ```python
  from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
  import requests

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/integrate-payment', methods=['POST'])
  def integrate_payment():
      data = request.json
      amount, token = data['amount'], data['token']
      response = requests.post('https://api.paymentprovider.com/charge',
                               headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("API_KEY")}'},
                               json={'amount': amount, 'token': token})
      return jsonify(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>
