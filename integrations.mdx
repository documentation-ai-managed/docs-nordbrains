## API Connections for E-Commerce

Connect Shopify to external APIs for inventory sync, order fulfillment, and customer data. Nordbrains uses webhooks and REST APIs to ensure real-time updates.

<ParamField path="orders" param-type="object" required="true">
  Sync new orders to your ERP system.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-Shopify-Access-Token" param-type="string" required="true">
  Your private app token: `shpat_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`.
</ParamField>

### Multi-Language API Example

<CodeGroup tabs="Node.js,Python">
  ````javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  async function syncOrder(shop, token, orderId) {
    const response = await axios.get(
      `https://YOUR_SHOP.myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-01/orders/${orderId}.json`,
      {
        headers: {
          'X-Shopify-Access-Token': token
        }
      }
    );
    console.log(response.data.order);
  }
  ````

  ````python
  import requests

  def sync_order(shop, token, order_id):
      url = f"https://{shop}/admin/api/2024-01/orders/{order_id}.json"
      headers = {"X-Shopify-Access-Token": token}
      response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
      print(response.json()["order"])
  ````
</CodeGroup>

## Custom Workflows and Automation

Build automated workflows like abandoned cart recovery or stock alerts. Nordbrains creates Zapier-like automations using Shopify Flow and custom scripts.

    A[Webhook Trigger] --> B[Process Order]
    B --> C{Stock Available?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Send Confirmation]
    C -- No --> E[Notify Supplier]
    D --> F[Update CRM]
    E --> F
```

      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"order_id": 12345}'
    ````
    </Request>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Automation Script" icon="play-circle">

## Best Practices for Scalable Integrations

Follow these guidelines to ensure your integrations perform under high traffic.

| Practice | Description | Benefit |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Use GraphQL | Prefer over REST for complex queries | Reduces bandwidth by `<50%` |
| Rate Limiting | Implement retries with exponential backoff | Prevents API throttling |
| Idempotency Keys | Add unique keys to requests | Handles duplicates safely |
| Monitoring | Log all API calls | Quick issue detection |
